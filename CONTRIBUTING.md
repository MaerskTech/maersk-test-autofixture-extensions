# Contributing
The framework for public contributions is being finalized so we do not accept public contributions just yet.

We'll update this document once this process has been released.

## Pull Request Process
1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, useful file locations and examples
2. Increase the version numbers in any csproj file and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. Please follow the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) versioning scheme
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you
